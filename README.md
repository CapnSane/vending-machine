#### Three reasons why there are so many vending machines in Japan

**1. Japan is really safe**
One of the websites that I used to check for _quality of life_ is [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/). When we check the _Safety Index_ of the Japanese cities we always see the index classified as high or very high. There is very little vandalism and robbery is almost inexistent. Because of this, vending machines are installed everywhere in Japan, such as sidewalks, alleys, parks, and many other public spaces.

**2. Everyone can become a vending machine owner, just have a good spot to put them**
Do you need extra money? Do you have a vacant place in front your house? So, you can apply to have your own vending machine. If the application is approved by the management company, you only must pay the installation fee and it's done! If the spot you chose is good, you can receive a good amount of money from this way per month.

**3. Convenience and ease of maintenance**
Like the most crowded cities in the world, Tokyo is known as a city that never sleeps. Not only Tokyo, but Japan is very famous for its long working day, even in the countryside cities. When we see the routine in cities like New York, São Paulo, and Tokyo, it's common observing workers eating hot dogs in the lunch time, eating something fast in a shopping maul near from work, or eating some fast food. In Japan is not different, people are too busy to hit up the nearest convenience store; vending machines are the most convenient "store" for grabbing a quick food and drink on the way. And what to say about the maintenance... the maintenance is simply flawless, fast, and completely reliable. Specialized maintenance companies make sure that there’s no litter, restock the machines regularly, and perform all sorts of other maintenance-related tasks. Some companies have control softwares that can identify what is happening with the consumption, being able to identify which kind of product needs to be replaced.
